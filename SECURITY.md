# Security Implementation Guide

## üîê Project Security Overview

This document outlines the specific security measures implemented in the MLOps Infrastructure as Code project, covering network security, credential management, and access controls.

## üåê Network Security Implementation

### VPC Isolation
The infrastructure implements a dedicated Virtual Private Cloud with comprehensive network segmentation. A private network using the `10.0.0.0/16` CIDR block isolates all resources from the public internet. The architecture includes subnet segmentation with a public subnet (`10.0.1.0/24`) for internet-facing resources and a private subnet (`10.0.2.0/24`) for internal services. Internet access is controlled through a dedicated Internet Gateway that provides secure outbound connectivity.

### Security Groups Configuration
Security group rules are defined in `terraform/modules/security-groups/` and implement the principle of least privilege access. The web security group restricts SSH access to port 22 from configurable IP ranges, limiting administrative access to authorized networks. Kubernetes API access on port 6443 is restricted to VPC-internal traffic only, preventing external access to the cluster management interface. Application ports in the range 30080-30090 are configured for NodePort services, providing controlled access to MLOps applications.

The database security group ensures that PostgreSQL access on port 5432 is limited to internal communication only, accepting connections exclusively from the web security group. This prevents direct database access from external sources and maintains data security.

## üîë Credential Management System

### AWS Secrets Manager Integration
The project implements secure credential management through AWS Secrets Manager, eliminating hardcoded secrets in the infrastructure code. The implementation can be found in `scripts/new_script.sh` through the `get_secret_from_secrets_manager()` function. This function securely retrieves credentials at runtime, ensuring sensitive information is never stored in plain text.

The secret storage structure maintains AWS credentials including access keys and regional configuration in encrypted format within Secrets Manager. The retrieval process uses AWS CLI with JSON parsing to extract specific credential components while maintaining security through encrypted transmission and storage.

### Kubernetes Secret Management
Dynamic secret creation is implemented through the `create_kubernetes_secrets()` function in the deployment script. This approach creates secrets at runtime rather than storing them in manifest files, significantly improving security posture.

Multi-namespace secret isolation ensures that each MLOps component operates with scoped access. The Airflow namespace contains AWS credentials, admin credentials, and database credentials. The MLflow namespace includes AWS credentials and MLflow-specific configuration. The Inference namespace maintains AWS credentials and service configuration. This separation ensures that components cannot access secrets outside their operational scope.

## üõ°Ô∏è Access Control Implementation

### IAM Role-Based Security
Identity and Access Management implementation is located in `terraform/modules/iam/` and follows AWS security best practices. EC2 instances operate under service-specific IAM roles rather than using hardcoded access keys, reducing the risk of credential exposure.

The EC2 instance profile provides minimal permissions necessary for operation, adhering to the principle of least privilege. Secrets Manager access is scoped to specific secret resources, ensuring instances can only access the credentials they require for operation. This granular permission model prevents unauthorized access to sensitive resources.

### Kubernetes RBAC
Service-specific access controls are implemented through Kubernetes Role-Based Access Control. Each MLOps component operates within its own namespace, providing isolation and controlled access to resources. Secrets are scoped to specific namespaces, preventing cross-service access to sensitive information. Network policies isolate inter-service communication, ensuring that services can only communicate through defined channels.

## üîí Application Security Measures

### Airflow Security
Airflow security configuration is managed through the `install_airflow()` function in the deployment script. Authentication and authorization are enabled with configurable admin credentials that are retrieved from secure storage rather than hardcoded values. Secret injection uses Kubernetes secret references to provide AWS credentials and configuration to Airflow components without exposing sensitive data in container specifications.

### MLflow Security
MLflow security implementation is handled in the `setup_mlflow()` function and focuses on secure backend storage and credential management. S3 backend security includes encrypted artifact storage with IAM-based access controls and VPC endpoints for private S3 communication. Database security ensures that MLflow tracking data is protected through encrypted connections and access controls.

### Inference API Security
The inference service security configuration is implemented in the `install_inference_server()` function. Container security measures include non-root execution contexts, read-only filesystem configurations where possible, and minimal base images with regular security patches. This approach reduces the attack surface and limits potential security vulnerabilities.

## üö® Security Monitoring & Logging

### CloudWatch Integration
Comprehensive logging is implemented with automatic log forwarding to CloudWatch for centralized monitoring. Security event logging captures all userdata script execution in `/var/log/k8s-data.log`, providing a complete audit trail of deployment activities. Failed authentication attempts are tracked and logged for security monitoring purposes.

Metrics collection is configured through StatsD integration, enabling real-time monitoring of system performance and security events. This provides visibility into system behavior and enables rapid detection of anomalous activities.

### Container Security Scanning
Custom Docker images undergo security scanning as part of the deployment process. Base images are regularly updated with security patches through the CI/CD pipeline. Vulnerability scanning occurs before deployment to ensure that known security issues are addressed before production use.

---

## üîß Deployment Security

### Userdata Script Security
The deployment script located at `scripts/new_script.sh` implements several security measures during the installation process. Root execution is required for system-level configuration but is carefully controlled and logged. Credential retrieval occurs dynamically from AWS Secrets Manager at runtime, ensuring no sensitive data is embedded in the script.

The installation process includes verification steps for each component, ensuring that security measures are properly implemented before proceeding to the next phase. All script execution is logged for audit purposes, and the script uses fail-safe operations that exit on any error to prevent incomplete or insecure configurations.

### Terraform State Security
State file security is configured in `terraform/main.tf` with S3 backend encryption and versioning. Server-side encryption protects state files at rest, while versioning enables secure recovery from previous configurations. Access logging provides an audit trail for state file modifications, ensuring accountability for infrastructure changes.

## üìã Security Compliance

### Infrastructure Security Standards
The infrastructure implements comprehensive security standards across multiple layers. Network security includes VPC isolation with dedicated private networking, subnet segmentation separating public and private resources, security groups implementing least privilege access, and database isolation in private subnets preventing public access.

Data security measures include encryption at rest for EBS volumes, encryption in transit for all communications, AWS Secrets Manager integration for credential management, and dynamic secret retrieval eliminating plaintext credentials in code.

Access control implementation includes IAM roles with service-specific permissions, Kubernetes namespace isolation with RBAC controls, SSH key management with configurable key pairs, and service-level authentication for application access.

### Operational Security
Operational security measures include CloudWatch integration for audit logging, metrics collection for monitoring and alerting, persistent volume backup strategies for data protection, and automated security patch management for system updates.

## üîÑ Security Maintenance

### Regular Security Tasks
Security maintenance follows a structured schedule with weekly reviews of CloudWatch logs for anomalies, monitoring for failed authentication attempts, and resource utilization analysis. Monthly tasks include AWS access key rotation, container base image updates, security group rule reviews, and Kubernetes version updates.

Quarterly activities encompass comprehensive security audits of IAM policies, penetration testing exercises, disaster recovery testing, and security documentation updates to ensure continued compliance and effectiveness.

### Security Incident Response
The incident response framework includes detection mechanisms through CloudWatch alarms for suspicious activity, failed deployment notifications, and resource utilization alerts. Response procedures follow a structured approach: isolate suspicious services, investigate through log and metric analysis, remediate by applying security patches, and document findings to update security procedures.
